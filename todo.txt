insert a tree widget that lists incomplete files
add ignored file list

front: view only relevant rules and their files
front: view violating (unparsed) files
try to make history snapshots easier and less triggery
try to not actually delete file records
implement rule editor
add basic reporting and search
implement per-user settings
implement mounting dir for each user
# compute differences before pushing to db



back: create hasura ingress tables without any validation and trigger on these, don't write to output tables




Use cases:
 - detect incomplete bundles and unrelated files in the bundles as they appear
 - find some files by tags that may have been deleted
 - use links to find raw data used in a particular report
 - get a time slice of related files
 - find non-compliant files




 
create an api endpoint for endpoint crud => new table for endpoints
// need to derive destination from mounted dir
?only store relative path within destination
